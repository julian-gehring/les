Description: The 'les' package estimates Loci of Enhanced Significance (LES) in tiling microarray data. These are regions of regulation such as found in differential transcription, CHiP-chip or methylation experiments. The package provides a universal framework suitable of identifying regulatory effects in various data sets and is independent of the underlying statistics at the level of single probes.
