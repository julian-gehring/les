\title{regions}

\description{
  Estimates regions of continuously elevated
  \eqn{\Lambda_i}{Lambda}. These are distinct regions of regulation.
}
      
\usage{
regions(object, limit=NULL, minLength=2, maxGap=Inf, verbose = FALSE)

\S4method{regions}{Les}(object, limit=NULL, minLength=2, maxGap=Inf,
verbose = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{Object of class 'Les' as returned by 'threshold'.}
  \item{limit}{Numeric specifying the threshold \eqn{\Theta}{Theta} for
    \eqn{\Lambda}{Lambda} with regions are defined as
    \eqn{\Lambda_i\geq\Theta}{Lambda>=Theta}. If missing
    \eqn{\Theta}{Theta} will be derived from the estimated number of
    regulated probes as computed by 'threshold'.}
  \item{minLength}{Integer specifying the minimum number of probes in a
    region. If not specified regions can have arbitrary small size.}
  \item{maxGap}{Integer specifying maximum gap in base pairs between two
    neighboring probes in a region. If this value is exceeded the region
    will be split into smaller ones such that maxGap is not exceed by
    any pair of neighboring probes. If not specified arbitrary large gap
    sizes are allowed.}
  \item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether a summary of the estimated
    regions should be printed on screen (default: FALSE).}
}

\details{
  This method finds distinct regions in \eqn{\Lambda}{Lambda} by
  thresholding with \eqn{\Theta}{Theta}. The regions have to fulfill the
  following criteria:

  (1) For all probes in the region
  \eqn{\Lambda_i\geq\Theta}{Lambda>=Theta} has to hold.
  (2) Each region has to contain at least as many probes as specified in
  'minLength'.
  (3) The gap between to neighboring probes has to be smaller or equal
  to 'maxGap'.

  Along with the boundaries of the regions the number of regulated
  probes within each region is estimated. This is used to sort the
  regions in order to get a list of top regions. The resulting data
  frame containing the regions can be accessed with the '[' method.
 }

\value{
  Object of class 'Les' with additionally filled slots:
  regions, limit

  'regions' is a data frame with variables:
  \item{chr}{Chromosome the regions is located on.}
  \item{start}{Position of the beginning of the region.}
  \item{end}{Position of the end of the region.}
  \item{size}{Extend of the region in base pairs (measured in the same
    units as input 'pos').}
  \item{nProbes}{Number of probes in the region.}
  \item{ri}{Regulation Index of the region indicating the fraction of
    regulated probes in the region.}
  \item{se}{Standard error of the estimation of 'ri'.}
  \item{rs}{Regulation score defined as 'ri'/'se'. The data frame is
    sorted by this variable.}
